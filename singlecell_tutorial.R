# Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "/Users/minju/Downloads/hg19/hg19")

###01. Standard pre-processing workflow
# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata. This is a great place to stash QC stats
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")

# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)

# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

plot1 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mt")

###02. Normalizing the data
pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
#pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc)

#Identification of highly variable features (feature selection)
#Note: why? selected feature removes noise in clustering

# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(pbmc), 10)

# plot variable features with and without labels
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(pbmc)
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE)
plot1 + plot2

###3. Scaling the data
all.genes <- rownames(pbmc)
pbmc <- ScaleData(pbmc, features = all.genes)

###4. PCA - Perform linear dimensional reduction
pbmc <- RunPCA(pbmc, features = VariableFeatures(object = pbmc))
# Examine and visualize PCA results a few different ways
print(pbmc[["pca"]], dims = 1:5, nfeatures = 5)

#Determine the ???˜dimensionality?????? of the dataset
# NOTE: This process can take a long time for big datasets, comment out for expediency. More
# approximate techniques such as those implemented in ElbowPlot() can be used to reduce
# computation time
#You can use JackStraw or Elbowplot 
pbmc <- JackStraw(pbmc, num.replicate = 100)
pbmc <- ScoreJackStraw(pbmc, dims = 1:20)
JackStrawPlot(pbmc, dims = 1:15)

ElbowPlot(pbmc)

# Look at cluster IDs of the first 5 cells
head(Idents(pbmc), 5)

# If you haven't installed UMAP, you can do so via reticulate::py_install(packages =
# 'umap-learn')
pbmc <- RunUMAP(pbmc, dims = 1:10)

# note that you can set `label = TRUE` or use the LabelClusters function to help label
# individual clusters
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap")

# find all markers of cluster 1

# find all markers distinguishing cluster 5 from clusters 0 and 3
cluster5.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 5, ident.2 = c(0, 3), min.pct = 0.25)
#findmarker function -> find markers among 5 and 0~3
